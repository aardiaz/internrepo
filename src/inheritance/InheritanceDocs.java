	 * -------------------- Inheritance ------------------
	 *   # use for code re-usability
	 *   # process of accessing properties and methods of parent/base/super class
	 *     to child/derived/sub class is known as inheritance.
	 *     
	 *   # Also known as IS-A relationship
	 *   # Its a generalization to specialization process.
	 *   # we can inherit only one class at a time.
	 *   # We can't inherit private properties,methods and constructors.
	 *   # We can inherit static variable and methods.
	 *   # 'extends' keyword is used to inherit.
	 *   # Multiple inheritance not supported in class level but it happens in 
	 *      Interface.
	 *      
	 *   # syntax :
	 *      
	 *            child-class   extends  parent-class{
	 *            
	 *                 //properties : parent + child
	 *                   
	 *                 //methods  :  parent + child
	 *            
	 *            }
	 *   
	 *   e.g.
	 *        class A{
	 *        
	 *        }
	 *        
	 *        class B extends A{
	 *        
	 *        }
	 *        
	 *        class C extends B{
	 *        
	 *        }
